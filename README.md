# 🌟 **Disease Prediction and Recommendation System Using ML** 🌟

## 📄 **Project Overview**
The **Disease Prediction System** leverages machine learning algorithms to provide accurate disease predictions based on user symptoms and recommend suitable precautions, diets, medications, and workout activities.  The system uses advanced models like **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** and **Random Forest** to analyze medical data, offering personalized disease predictions, suggested medications, and preventive measures.
